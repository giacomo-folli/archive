Lately I've been thinking that I should work on gratitude. 

I often think about all the ways I could improve myself, all the mistakes I make or all the times when I wasn't enough. You get the game. Surely, you understand that it's very risky.

Because even if it's right to identify your own mistakes and separate them from those of others, if you only do this you risk ending up in a spiral playing cops and robbers with yourself.

I want to learn to nurture the attention to all the things that went well, without even needing to find the cause. Just being grateful for the things and people that are here. Beyond everything else that often fades and leaves little behind.

Nurture gratitude over judgement.

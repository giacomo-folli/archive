#### University
My goal now is to master my remaining subjects deeply and find practical ways to apply what I’ve learned. I am currently completing my final courses, including Linear Algebra, Calculus, Electronics, Signal Analysis, and Automated Controls.

#### Learning
I'm currently learning Rust on my own. I almost completed the `rustlings` training excercises. I started developing some small personal tools to get some experience with it.

#### Health and Fitness
Training for the upcoming [VerdiMarathon](https://www.verdimarathon.it/) (22 February). I will attempt the 21km track.

I want to build a more consistent training routine that prioritizes regularity over intensity. My goal is to maintain my current fitness level while ensuring the runs stay enjoyable and stress-free.

#### Other
Looking ahead I’d like to get myself into some outdoor climbing communities to practice with someone better than me (and make new friends in the meantime).\
I would also like to travel more, so if you have any suggestion on places to visit... let me know! :)

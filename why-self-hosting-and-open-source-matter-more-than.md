In today's world everything you do online can be tracked, stored and monetized.

Free apps, smart devices, AI assistants  -  they all come with a hidden cost: your data. \\
Even the platforms you trust most are constantly harvesting information under the name of "personalization" or "improving user experience."

The explosion of AI has only made things worse. Privacy policies are just legal shields, and regulation is still stuck in the 2010s.
So yeah, in 2025, digital privacy is… _tricky_. \\ But lately there's a simple and alternative way that's becoming more and more popular.

### Open source software changes the game.
It's transparent and community-driven so there are no black boxes. Self-hosting takes this one step further :  it puts you in the driver's seat.
You run your own services on your own hardware or a trusted cloud.
No middlemen. Just you and your machine.

### Not Just for "Hackers" Anymore
Self-hosting used to be a niche hobby for sysadmins, coders or command-line cowboys, but in 2025 the scenario has changed dramatically.

Platforms like _CasaOS_ have made it insanely simple to set up your own services and providers like Hetzner give you basic tier servers for less than 5$ a month.

Chances are, most of what you do with Google or Microsoft can be replaced today:
* For notes, try _Joplin_ or _Standard Notes_
* For file sync, _Nextcloud_ is a beast (and only getting better) [^1]
* Want to ditch Google Calendar? Use _Radicale_ or _Baïkal_
* Replace your password manager with _Bitwarden_, self-hosted and secure [^2]
* Follow news with _FreshRSS_ or _Miniflux_ 
* _Matrix_ is the decentralized Slack of the future (or present really!)

The ecosystem is rich, modern, and surprisingly stable. And every service you host is one less point of surveillance in your life.

### Closing thoughts
Self-hosting won't fix everything. But it will give you a piece of the internet that's actually yours. You don't need to be a developer or a Linux guru.

Just curious, a bit patient, and maybe willing to repurpose an old laptop or Raspberry Pi.

In 2025, digital privacy isn't dead. **It's becoming a movement**.

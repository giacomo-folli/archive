These days I'm preparing for _Telecommunications Systems_ and I hope to take the exam on January 30th. 

If it doesn't work out, I have a second attempt on February 17th. TS is a subject very far removed from anything I'm interested in or feel suited for. 

It's a sort of wave physics applied to electronics, with information theory mixed in. An atomic combination.

Anyway, these days I'm studying a lot of material I don't understand and that, honestly, makes me feel very stupid, or perhaps, more than anything, inadequate for this field of study.

As for the rest, nothing today. I didn't run because I want to leave at least one recovery day between runs. I didn't even go to the library with my friend lollo. it was a pretty dull day.

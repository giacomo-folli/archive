Today I was thinking about my last blog post [The subtle art of…](https://paco.bearblog.dev/the-subtle-art-of) and I came up with a somewhat similar format.

Some failures that turn out to be just beginnings:

* **When I lost my hiking boots on a bench**, then I discovered that I prefer trail running shoes and running down mountains
* **When I broke my laptop with all my music project on it**, then I found again the joy of picking up a real instrument and just play
* **When the train gets cancelled last minute** and I treat myself to a coffee at the bar while waiting for the next one
* **When a rainy day** forces me to find a new book to start

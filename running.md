This week I ran 16km in total, 10km on Tuesday and 6km yesterday evening. Maybe on Saturday I'll close at 26/28km, the best would be 30km but only because it's round.

In truth, the last few months have been similar, and I can finally say that this is the first time I've managed to maintain this pace for more than three months straight (with Christmas and New Year in between, no less). So I wanted to write down a few thoughts.

Lately I've realized that running is helping me with a fairly widespread problem in my days: _learning to put things in perspective_.

Often, I've found myself with a bunch of thoughts concentrated on something that was weighing on me down and I was not able to fully calm down. 
Those same times, I discovered that a run, not even too long, removed most of the noise for me.

Running is a break. 

I stop thinking about the fact that I'm behind with my studies or have problems at work or whatever else and I focus on the present, _on putting one foot in front of the other and controlling my breathing_. \\
This helps me a lot, because it reminds me that there's a world of other things that continue to exist even if something goes wrong.

Running is just another commitment, another challenge, another exam I can train for knowing that the result depends completely on me and me alone. \\
Other observations about my runs:
1. My left knee often hurts
1. I generally sleep better the days after
1. Very tiring and rarely improving

Yesterday, I caught myself mulling over an [article](https://josebrowne.com/on-coding-ego-and-attention/) on not taking my code too personally.

In short, the author argues that to become a better engineer, you must master detaching your ego from your work and focus your full attention on the task itself rather than on self-evaluation or the fear of failure.

I was struck by this. It seemed the author was speaking directly to me. I often find myself perfecting a piece of code that already works just because I want it to be perfect, but not for the usefulness of having perfect code, rather for a matter of *"reputation"*. I want my code to be known as _perfect_, as the _good example_.

But as much as this commitment may be necessary at a certain level, this is a dangerous direction to venture into. I say this from experience. I often end up focusing on the wrong problems or giving too much weight to certain comments I receive.

It’s one of those things that is simple to understand but incredibly hard to do. Even when you know the "_rules_" for staying detached, your brain still defaults to taking the work personally.

I think it's also an effort that the community needs to make, because if so many people have the same problem (_my assumption_), maybe we should also ask ourselves some questions about the work culture we want to foster, and the expectations we want each others to meet.

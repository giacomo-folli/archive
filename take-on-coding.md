I read an interesting take[^1]:
> On a meta-level, coding is about making observations and identifying relationships. These observations result in little hypotheses for us to test out. So it’s about having the, "Hmm 🧐..., this thing over here might be what's causing that thing over there 🤔", moments. Over and over. Without getting in our own way when, for example, one of these little hypotheses gets proven false.

I wanted to save it here. Maybe tomorrow I'll write something on this.
